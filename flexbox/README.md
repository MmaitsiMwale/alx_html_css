# Introduction to Flexbox

This project introduces the flexible box or commonly known as flexbox as an efficient tool to style and position elements in an html file.
Flexbox offers properties for a flexbox container (parent) and flex items (children). Each of these properties forces different behavior from the elements.
Flexbox is a powerful layout tool that allows us to easily create responsive designs.
