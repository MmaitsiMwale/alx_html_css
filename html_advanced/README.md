<h><u>HTML ADVANCED: DEEP DIVE</u></h>
<h1>Deep Dive Into Advanced html</h1>
<p>
    In this module, we dive deep into html, exploring concepts such as semantics, advanced elements, positioning of elements, attributes, and more.

    We recreate a wireframe made from figma, by manually turning it into html. By recreating each element and positioning it well within the wireframe, we gain deep understanding of pure html semantics and the flexibility that markup afords us.
